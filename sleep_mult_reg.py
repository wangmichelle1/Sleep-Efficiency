sleep_mult_reg.py: Using a multiple linear regression model to predict sleep efficiency, REM sleep percentages, and deep
                   sleep percentages

This file presents how the R^2 value for when the multiple linear regression model predicts sleep efficiency,
REM sleep percentage, and deep sleep percentage is lower than that for the random forest regressor

The R^2 value of the multiple regression model hovers around 0.52 for predicting sleep efficiency, 0.08 for predicting
REM sleep percentage, and 0.27 for predicting deep sleep percentage

It appears that just using the top 3 features indicated by a random forest regressor for predicting sleep efficiency,
REM sleep percentage, and deep sleep percentage actually makes the regression models worse (lower R^2 values).
Additionally, all the created multiple linear regression models yield lower R^2 values than a corresponding random
forest regressor that predicts the same value. Therefore, our sleep predictors in random_forest_assets.py and sleep.py
only use a random forest regressor. """
