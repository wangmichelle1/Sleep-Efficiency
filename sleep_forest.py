sleep_forest.py: Building a random forest regressor to determine the attributes that best determine one's sleep
                 efficiency, REM sleep percentage, and deep sleep percentage

This file presents how the r^2 value for when the regressor predicts sleep efficiency, REM sleep percentage,
and deep sleep percentage is higher than that for multiple linear regression models predicting the same values.

Note that the random forest regressor used for the project is directly implemented in the sleep.py and
random_forest_assets.py file. This file just provides why we favored using a random forest regressor (higher r^2)
over multiple linear regression.

The r^2 value of this random forest regressor hovers around 0.67 for predicting sleep efficiency, 0.16 for predicting
REM sleep percentage, and 0.35 for predicting deep sleep percentage.

It appears that just using the top 3 important features to make predictions actually makes the random forest
regressors worse (lower cross-validated r^2). Therefore, we used all the variables in the random forest regressors when
we made the sleep predictor in sleep.py and random_forest_assets.py"""
